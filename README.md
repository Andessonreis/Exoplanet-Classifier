# Exoplanet Classifier

## Objective
*This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a Machine Learning technique, to classify exoplanets based on features provided by the NASA Exoplanets dataset.*

## Highlights
- **Machine Learning**: Implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for machine learning.
- **Dataset**: Utilization of the NASA Exoplanets dataset.
- **Classification**: Classifying exoplanets based on specific features.

*For more details on the Random Forest algorithm, refer to the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).*
